# Alpha Homora V2

Documentation coming soon. But here's what V2 will support:

- Multi assets lending and borrowing (with huge leverage for stablecoin farming!)
- More farming pools beyond just Uniswap (think Balancer, Curve, etc)
- Can keep the farming assets and not just dumping
- No more EOA only = more composability
- Cross margin for all your farming positions = harder to get liquidated
- You can bring your own LP tokens too = more flexibility
- Native flashloan support
- Yield farming on idle assets
